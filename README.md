The most frustrating virus ever
It is a worm that halts your system and stops it during critical system writes. For educational purposes only.
If you really need to, make a VM and run "fruit.bat", set executuion limit on your VM so it does not affect your host too badly.
You can make install version, I made it portable to show the concept, but it is for educational purposes only and making an install version that starts on boot would be dangerous.
